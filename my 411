Payday loans aren’t anybody’s first choice. You probably already know they’re an expensive way to get money — sometimes charging annual percentage rates of as much as 500-700%. What usually happens is that somebody needs money for a couple of weeks, to get them through ’til payday. So they take out a short-term loan with the idea of repaying it when they get paid. But studies have shown that very few people are one and done with payday loans. Instead, at payday, it may be hard to repay the loan plus the fees and interest. So you may roll it over for another two weeks. And then there are more fees and interest. And so on until people can wind up paying thousands of dollars to repay one $500 loan.
