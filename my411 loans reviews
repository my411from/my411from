So: read the terms of the loan really carefully. Add up how much you’ll have to pay if you can’t make that repayment in 2 weeks. And ask yourself: will taking out a payday loan do more to help or hurt you?

Sometimes there are only bad choices or worse choices. But you don’t want to be blindsided with the long-term bad as you’re trying to get back on your feet. So: check out the real cost of any loan before you sign, and learn more about payday lending.
